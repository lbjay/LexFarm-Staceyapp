Dear Lexington Selectmen,

One of the greatest gifts in my life is the view of Busa farm...I cherish every sunset as if it were a masterpiece of priceless art...please, I beg you to re-consider your decision to place housing along this view-scape...you may not have had the chance to experience what I have, but if you save this view, I invite you to come share this work of art with me...the summer is just around the corner...there are many masterpieces yet to come

Best,
Danielle Boudrot
